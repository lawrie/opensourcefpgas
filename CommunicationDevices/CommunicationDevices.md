# Comunication Devices

Many communication devices use a UART interface.

Some examples are Wifi, Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy devices.

## ESP8266 

A cheap way to get Wifi capability is to use an ESP8266 or an ESP32 module connected via UART. The cheapest of these is the ESP01 module.

These devices are supported in BlackSoC by the mod_rs232 module.

The ESP01 example shows how to use the ESP01 module.

## HC-10 Bluetooth Low Energy

The HC-10 module is a very cheap way to get Bluetooth Low Energy support.
